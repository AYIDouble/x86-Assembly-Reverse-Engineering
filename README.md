Knowledge I have found interesting about the topic of x86 assembly
## x86 Registers
![x86 assembly Registers](x86-registers.png)

In **x86 registers** have an '**e**' in front of their name.</br>
Example: **e**ax, **e**bx, **e**cx, **e**dx, **e**bp

*Additional Info: </br>
In **x64** you have a '**r**' instead.</br>
Example: **r**ax, **r**bx, **r**cx, **r**dx, **r**bp</br>
You also have **double-precision floating point going from xmm0 to xmm15**.*
